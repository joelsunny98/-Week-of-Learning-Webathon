# -Week-of-Learning-Webathon
This project is my submission for the #WeekofLearning Weabathon conducted at SICSR.  

The encryption system shall be used for communication between developers who want to exchange information is a safe and secure way. 
I have used JavaScript for the Business Logic that extracts each letter from the message, converts it into its ASCII value and adds the key given by the user. 
Then in return the ecrypted array will be decripted by the receiver using the same key which will subtracted from each index item in the array and converted back to the message.
